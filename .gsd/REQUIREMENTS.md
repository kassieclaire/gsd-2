# Requirements

This file is the explicit capability and coverage contract for the project.

## Active

### R001 — Fetch model registry from models.dev
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: Model data is fetched from https://models.dev/api.json at runtime instead of being statically compiled
- Why it matters: Keeps model registry current without code releases; new models available immediately
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: M001/S02
- Validation: S01 — Unit tests prove fetch with 10s timeout works (contract-level)
- Notes: Must handle network failures gracefully

### R002 — 12-hour cache with fallback on network failure
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Fetched model data is cached locally for ~12 hours; network failures fall back to cached data even if stale
- Why it matters: Reduces network requests, enables offline use, graceful degradation
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: S01 — Unit tests prove 12h TTL and fallback chain (contract-level)
- Notes: Cache file stored in ~/.gsd/agent/cache/

### R003 — Version-triggered cache refresh
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: When gsd-2 version changes, the cache is force-refreshed on next startup
- Why it matters: New releases may need updated model data; ensures consistency
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: S01 — Unit tests prove version comparison triggers refresh (contract-level)
- Notes: Compare cached version with current VERSION

### R004 — Bundled snapshot for offline-first cold start
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: A snapshot of models.dev data is bundled at build time for offline/fresh-install use
- Why it matters: Fresh installs work without network; faster cold start
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: S03 — Snapshot file committed, generation script works, fallback verified
- Notes: Generated via `npm run generate-snapshot`

### R005 — Preserve local models.json override capability
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: Users can still override/add models via ~/.gsd/agent/models.json
- Why it matters: Custom providers, local models, and overrides must continue to work
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: S02 — Implementation proves provider-level and per-model overrides work with models.dev data
- Notes: Existing ModelRegistry merge logic preserved

### R006 — Remove models.generated.ts and generation script
- Class: operability
- Status: validated
- Description: The static models.generated.ts file and any generation scripts are removed
- Why it matters: Eliminates stale generated code, simplifies build
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: S03 — File deleted, grep shows no source references
- Notes: Replaced by models-dev-snapshot.ts with different generation script

### R007 — Registry path build/test workflow must be trustworthy
- Class: operability
- Status: active
- Description: The model-registry-related code path can be built and tested through the project’s standard workflows without the current registry-specific build or resolver failures
- Why it matters: Test files and verification only count if the normal workflow can actually run them
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: Pending — standard build/test workflows execute registry-path verification successfully
- Notes: Includes repairing registry-path-specific import, type, and test-runner seams as needed

### R008 — Registry behavior must be proven through production-like startup scenarios
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: Model registry behavior is verified using production-like filesystem and startup scenarios covering fresh state, cache hit, stale cache, version change, snapshot fallback, offline behavior, and models.json overrides
- Why it matters: Contract-level unit tests alone do not prove the real startup path behaves correctly
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: Pending — scenario-driven tests exercise the real startup path under representative conditions
- Notes: Prefer temporary home/cache/models.json setups over deep mocks where practical

### R009 — Live models.dev verification in main suite
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: The main test suite includes live verification against models.dev as part of registry-path coverage
- Why it matters: Upstream compatibility should be checked against the real service, not only fixtures
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: Pending — main suite runs live models.dev verification with explicit failure surface
- Notes: This intentionally accepts network-dependent test behavior by user choice

### R010 — Model registry path quality hardening
- Class: operability
- Status: active
- Description: Code review findings in the model registry path are addressed with targeted cleanup and refactoring where needed to improve correctness, maintainability, and observability without changing intended behavior
- Why it matters: Better tests alone are not enough if the underlying design remains brittle or misleading
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: Pending — review findings resolved and revised code proven by the stronger verification path
- Notes: Scope includes adjacent infrastructure only when necessary to harden the registry path
